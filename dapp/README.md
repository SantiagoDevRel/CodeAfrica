1. Create react/nextjs app
2. delete all unuseful files/folders
3. delete all overwhelming/unused code to kind of start from 'scratch'
4. `npm i web3`
5. interact with the contract which was deployed in previous step (Contract2 folder)
6. no need of nice front end
7. make it work with metamask
8. deploy this to fleek
9. NEXT STEPS for the devs:
   - improve front end
   - add try/catch errors
   - add validations (connect wallet first, edit the amount to donate, etc)
